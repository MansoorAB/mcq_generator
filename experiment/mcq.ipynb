Another major theme is evolution, which explains the unity and diversity of life.[1][2][3] Energy processing is also important to life as it allows organisms to move, grow, and reproduce.[1][2][3] Finally, all organisms are able to regulate their own internal environments.[1][2][3][4][5]\\n\\nBiologists are able to study life at multiple levels of organization,[1] from the molecular biology of a cell to the anatomy and physiology of plants and animals, and evolution of populations.[1][6] Hence, there are multiple subdisciplines within biology, each defined by the nature of their research questions and the tools that they use.[7][8][9] Like other scientists, biologists use the scientific method to make observations, pose questions, generate hypotheses, perform experiments, and form conclusions about the world around them.[1]\\n\\nLife on Earth, which emerged more than 3.7 billion years ago,[10] is immensely diverse. Biologists have sought to study and classify the various forms of life, from prokaryotic organisms such as archaea and bacteria to eukaryotic organisms such as protists, fungi, plants, and animals. These various organisms contribute to the biodiversity of an ecosystem, where they play specialized roles in the cycling of nutrients and energy through their biophysical environment.',\n",

      "page_content='Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2015\\nThe most important distinguishing feature of this approach from the basic encoder–decoder is that\\nit does not attempt to encode a whole input sentence into a single ﬁxed-length vector. Instead, it en-\\ncodes the input sentence into a sequence of vectors and chooses a subset of these vectors adaptively\\nwhile decoding the translation. This frees a neural translation model from having to squash all the\\ninformation of a source sentence, regardless of its length, into a ﬁxed-length vector. We show this\\nallows a model to cope better with long sentences.\\nIn this paper, we show that the proposed approach of jointly learning to align and translate achieves\\nsigniﬁcantly improved translation performance over the basic encoder–decoder approach. The im-\\nprovement is more apparent with longer sentences, but can be observed with sentences of any\\nlength. On the task of English-to-French translation, the proposed approach achieves, with a single\\nmodel, a translation performance comparable, or close, to the conventional phrase-based system.\\nFurthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the proposed model ﬁnds a linguistically plausible\\n(soft-)alignment between a source sentence and the corresponding target sentence.\\n2 B ACKGROUND : NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION\\nFrom a probabilistic perspective, translation is equivalent to ﬁnding a target sentence ythat max-\\nimizes the conditional probability of ygiven a source sentence x, i.e., arg maxyp(y|x). In\\nneural machine translation, we ﬁt a parameterized model to maximize the conditional probability\\nof sentence pairs using a parallel training corpus. Once the conditional distribution is learned by a\\ntranslation model, given a source sentence a corresponding translation can be generated by searching\\nfor the sentence that maximizes the conditional probability.\\nRecently, a number of papers have proposed the use of neural networks to directly learn this condi-\\ntional distribution (see, e.g., Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Cho et al. , 2014a; Sutskever et al. ,\\n2014; Cho et al. , 2014b; Forcada and ˜Neco, 1997). This neural machine translation approach typ-\\nically consists of two components, the ﬁrst of which encodes a source sentence xand the second\\ndecodes to a target sentence y. For instance, two recurrent neural networks (RNN) were used by\\n(Cho et al. , 2014a) and (Sutskever et al. , 2014) to encode a variable-length source sentence into a\\nﬁxed-length vector and to decode the vector into a variable-length target sentence.\\nDespite being a quite new approach, neural machine translation has already shown promising results.\\nSutskever et al. (2014) reported that the neural machine translation based on RNNs with long short-\\nterm memory (LSTM) units achieves close to the state-of-the-art performance of the conventional\\nphrase-based machine translation system on an English-to-French translation task.1Adding neural\\ncomponents to existing translation systems, for instance, to score the phrase pairs in the phrase\\ntable (Cho et al. , 2014a) or to re-rank candidate translations (Sutskever et al. , 2014), has allowed to\\nsurpass the previous state-of-the-art performance level.\\n2.1 RNN E NCODER –DECODER\\nHere, we describe brieﬂy the underlying framework, called RNN Encoder–Decoder , proposed by\\nCho et al. (2014a) and Sutskever et al. (2014) upon which we build a novel architecture that learns\\nto align and translate simultaneously.\\nIn the Encoder–Decoder framework, an encoder reads the input sentence, a sequence of vectors\\nx= (x1,···,xTx), into a vector c.2The most common approach is to use an RNN such that\\nht=f(xt,ht−1) (1)\\nand\\nc=q({h1,···,hTx}),\\nwhereht∈Rnis a hidden state at time t, andcis a vector generated from the sequence of the\\nhidden states. fandqare some nonlinear functions. Sutskever et al. (2014) used an LSTM as fand\\nq({h1,···,hT}) =hT, for instance.\\n1We mean by the state-of-the-art performance, the performance of the conventional phrase-based system' metadata={'source': '../attention.pdf', 'page': 1}\n"

       " 'Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2015\\nThe most important distinguishing feature of this approach from the basic encoder–decoder is that\\nit does not attempt to encode a whole input sentence into a single ﬁxed-length vector. Instead, it en-\\ncodes the input sentence into a sequence of vectors and chooses a subset of these vectors adaptively\\nwhile decoding the translation. This frees a neural translation model from having to squash all the\\ninformation of a source sentence, regardless of its length, into a ﬁxed-length vector. We show this\\nallows a model to cope better with long sentences.\\nIn this paper, we show that the proposed approach of jointly learning to align and translate achieves\\nsigniﬁcantly improved translation performance over the basic encoder–decoder approach. The im-\\nprovement is more apparent with longer sentences, but can be observed with sentences of any\\nlength. On the task of English-to-French translation, the proposed approach achieves, with a single\\nmodel, a translation performance comparable, or close, to the conventional phrase-based system.\\nFurthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the proposed model ﬁnds a linguistically plausible\\n(soft-)alignment between a source sentence and the corresponding target sentence.\\n2 B ACKGROUND : NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION\\nFrom a probabilistic perspective, translation is equivalent to ﬁnding a target sentence ythat max-\\nimizes the conditional probability of ygiven a source sentence x, i.e., arg maxyp(y|x). In\\nneural machine translation, we ﬁt a parameterized model to maximize the conditional probability\\nof sentence pairs using a parallel training corpus. Once the conditional distribution is learned by a\\ntranslation model, given a source sentence a corresponding translation can be generated by searching\\nfor the sentence that maximizes the conditional probability.\\nRecently, a number of papers have proposed the use of neural networks to directly learn this condi-\\ntional distribution (see, e.g., Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Cho et al. , 2014a; Sutskever et al. ,\\n2014; Cho et al. , 2014b; Forcada and ˜Neco, 1997). This neural machine translation approach typ-\\nically consists of two components, the ﬁrst of which encodes a source sentence xand the second\\ndecodes to a target sentence y. For instance, two recurrent neural networks (RNN) were used by\\n(Cho et al. , 2014a) and (Sutskever et al. , 2014) to encode a variable-length source sentence into a\\nﬁxed-length vector and to decode the vector into a variable-length target sentence.\\nDespite being a quite new approach, neural machine translation has already shown promising results.\\nSutskever et al. (2014) reported that the neural machine translation based on RNNs with long short-\\nterm memory (LSTM) units achieves close to the state-of-the-art performance of the conventional\\nphrase-based machine translation system on an English-to-French translation task.1Adding neural\\ncomponents to existing translation systems, for instance, to score the phrase pairs in the phrase\\ntable (Cho et al. , 2014a) or to re-rank candidate translations (Sutskever et al. , 2014), has allowed to\\nsurpass the previous state-of-the-art performance level.\\n2.1 RNN E NCODER –DECODER\\nHere, we describe brieﬂy the underlying framework, called RNN Encoder–Decoder , proposed by\\nCho et al. (2014a) and Sutskever et al. (2014) upon which we build a novel architecture that learns\\nto align and translate simultaneously.\\nIn the Encoder–Decoder framework, an encoder reads the input sentence, a sequence of vectors\\nx= (x1,···,xTx), into a vector c.2The most common approach is to use an RNN such that\\nht=f(xt,ht−1) (1)\\nand\\nc=q({h1,···,hTx}),\\nwhereht∈Rnis a hidden state at time t, andcis a vector generated from the sequence of the\\nhidden states. fandqare some nonlinear functions.

       " 'Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2015\\nthe alignment is not considered to be a latent variable. Instead, the alignment model directly com-\\nputes a soft alignment, which allows the gradient of the cost function to be backpropagated through.\\nThis gradient can be used to train the alignment model as well as the whole translation model jointly.\\nWe can understand the approach of taking a weighted sum of all the annotations as computing an\\nexpected annotation , where the expectation is over possible alignments. Let αijbe a probability that\\nthe target word yiis aligned to, or translated from, a source word xj. Then, thei-th context vector\\nciis the expected annotation over all the annotations with probabilities αij.\\nThe probability αij, or its associated energy eij, reﬂects the importance of the annotation hjwith\\nrespect to the previous hidden state si−1in deciding the next state siand generating yi. Intuitively,\\nthis implements a mechanism of attention in the decoder. The decoder decides parts of the source\\nsentence to pay attention to. By letting the decoder have an attention mechanism, we relieve the\\nencoder from the burden of having to encode all information in the source sentence into a ﬁxed-\\nlength vector. With this new approach the information can be spread throughout the sequence of\\nannotations, which can be selectively retrieved by the decoder accordingly.\\n3.2 E NCODER : BIDIRECTIONAL RNN FOR ANNOTATING SEQUENCES\\nThe usual RNN, described in Eq. (1), reads an input sequence xin order starting from the ﬁrst\\nsymbolx1to the last one xTx. However, in the proposed scheme, we would like the annotation\\nof each word to summarize not only the preceding words, but also the following words. Hence,\\nwe propose to use a bidirectional RNN (BiRNN, Schuster and Paliwal, 1997), which has been\\nsuccessfully used recently in speech recognition (see, e.g., Graves et al. , 2013).\\nA BiRNN consists of forward and backward RNN’s. The forward RNN− →freads the input sequence\\nas it is ordered (from x1toxTx) and calculates a sequence of forward hidden states (− →h1,···,− →hTx).\\nThe backward RNN← −freads the sequence in the reverse order (from xTxtox1), resulting in a\\nsequence of backward hidden states (← −h1,···,← −hTx).\\nWe obtain an annotation for each word xjby concatenating the forward hidden state− →hjand the\\nbackward one← −hj, i.e.,hj=[− →h⊤\\nj;← −h⊤\\nj]⊤\\n. In this way, the annotation hjcontains the summaries\\nof both the preceding words and the following words. Due to the tendency of RNNs to better\\nrepresent recent inputs, the annotation hjwill be focused on the words around xj. This sequence\\nof annotations is used by the decoder and the alignment model later to compute the context vector\\n(Eqs. (5)–(6)).\\nSee Fig. 1 for the graphical illustration of the proposed model.\\n4 E XPERIMENT SETTINGS\\nWe evaluate the proposed approach on the task of English-to-French translation. We use the bilin-\\ngual, parallel corpora provided by ACL WMT ’14.3As a comparison, we also report the perfor-\\nmance of an RNN Encoder–Decoder which was proposed recently by Cho et al. (2014a).

Its decoder has 1000 hidden units.

Each SGD update direction is computed using a minibatch of 80 sen-\\ntences. We trained each model for approximately 5 days.\\nOnce a model is trained, we use a beam search to ﬁnd a translation that approximately maximizes the\\nconditional probability (see, e.g., Graves, 2012; Boulanger-Lewandowski et al. , 2013).

This is done by visualizing the annotation\\nweightsαijfrom Eq. (6), as in Fig. 3. Each row of a matrix in each plot indicates the weights\\nassociated with the annotations. From this we see which positions in the source sentence were\\nconsidered more important when generating the target word.\\nWe can see from the alignments in Fig. 3 that the alignment of words between English and French\\nis largely monotonic. We see strong weights along the diagonal of each matrix. However, we also\\nobserve a number of non-trivial, non-monotonic alignments. Adjectives and nouns are typically\\nordered differently between French and English, and we see an example in Fig. 3 (a). From this\\nﬁgure, we see that the model correctly translates a phrase [European Economic Area] into [zone\\n´economique europ ´een]. The RNNsearch was able to correctly align [zone] with [Area], jumping\\nover the two words ([European] and [Economic]), and then looked one word back at a time to\\ncomplete the whole phrase [zone ´economique europ ´eenne].\\nThe strength of the soft-alignment, opposed to a hard-alignment, is evident, for instance, from\\nFig. 3 (d). Consider the source phrase [the man] which was translated into [l’ homme]. Any hard\\nalignment will map [the] to [l’] and [man] to [homme]. This is not helpful for translation, as one\\nmust consider the word following [the] to determine whether it should be translated into [le], [la],\\n[les] or [l’]. Our soft-alignment solves this issue naturally by letting the model look at both [the] and\\n[man], and in this example, we see that the model was able to correctly translate [the] into [l’]. We\\nobserve similar behaviors in all the presented cases in Fig. 3. An additional beneﬁt of the soft align-\\nment is that it naturally deals with source and target phrases of different lengths, without requiring a\\ncounter-intuitive way of mapping some words to or from nowhere ([NULL]) (see, e.g., Chapters 4\\nand 5 of Koehn, 2010).\\n5.2.2 L ONG SENTENCES\\nAs clearly visible from Fig. 2 the proposed model (RNNsearch) is much better than the conventional\\nmodel (RNNencdec) at translating long sentences. This is likely due to the fact that the RNNsearch\\ndoes not require encoding a long sentence into a ﬁxed-length vector perfectly, but only accurately\\nencoding the parts of the input sentence that surround a particular word.\\nAs an example, consider this source sentence from the test set:\\nAn admitting privilege is the right of a doctor to admit a patient to a hospital or\\na medical centre tocarry outadiagnosis oraprocedure, based onhisstatus asa\\nhealth care worker atahospital.\\nThe RNNencdec-50 translated this sentence into:\\nUn privil `ege d’admission est le droit d’un m ´edecin de reconna ˆıtre un patient `a\\nl’hˆopital ou un centre m ´edical d’un diagnostic oudeprendre undiagnostic en\\nfonction deson´etatdesant´e.\\n7',\n",
       " 'Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2015\\nThe RNNencdec-50 correctly translated the source sentence until [a medical center].

For instance, it\\nreplaced [based on his status as a health care worker at a hospital] in the source sentence with [en\\nfonction de son ´etat de sant ´e] (“based on his state of health”).\\nOn the other hand, the RNNsearch-50 generated the following correct translation, preserving the\\nwhole meaning of the input sentence without omitting any details:\\nUn privil `ege d’admission est le droit d’un m ´edecin d’admettre un patient `a un\\nhˆopital ou un centre m ´edical pour effectuer undiagnostic ouuneproc´edure, selon\\nsonstatut detravailleur dessoins desant´e`al’hˆopital.\\nLet us consider another sentence from the test set:\\nThis kind of experience is part of Disney’s efforts to ”extend the lifetime of its\\nseries and build new relationships with audiences viadigital platforms that are\\nbecoming ever more important, ” headded.\\nThe translation by the RNNencdec-50 is\\nCe type d’exp ´erience fait partie des initiatives du Disney pour ”prolonger la dur ´ee\\nde vie de ses nouvelles et de d ´evelopper des liens avec les lecteurs num´eriques qui\\ndeviennent plus complexes.\\nAs with the previous example, the RNNencdec began deviating from the actual meaning of the\\nsource sentence after generating approximately 30 words (see the underlined phrase). After that\\npoint, the quality of the translation deteriorates, with basic mistakes such as the lack of a closing\\nquotation mark.\\nAgain, the RNNsearch-50 was able to translate this long sentence correctly:\\nCe genre d’exp ´erience fait partie des efforts de Disney pour ”prolonger la dur ´ee\\nde vie de ses s ´eries et cr ´eer de nouvelles relations avec des publics viades\\nplateformes num´eriques deplus enplus importantes”, a-t-il ajout ´e.\\nIn conjunction with the quantitative results presented already, these qualitative observations con-\\nﬁrm our hypotheses that the RNNsearch architecture enables far more reliable translation of long\\nsentences than the standard RNNencdec model.\\nIn Appendix C, we provide a few more sample translations of long source sentences generated by\\nthe RNNencdec-50, RNNsearch-50 and Google Translate along with the reference translations.\\n6 R ELATED WORK\\n6.1 L EARNING TO ALIGN\\nA similar approach of aligning an output symbol with an input symbol was proposed recently by\\nGraves (2013) in the context of handwriting synthesis. Handwriting synthesis is a task where the\\nmodel is asked to generate handwriting of a given sequence of characters. In his work, he used a\\nmixture of Gaussian kernels to compute the weights of the annotations, where the location, width\\nand mixture coefﬁcient of each kernel was predicted from an alignment model. More speciﬁcally,\\nhis alignment was restricted to predict the location such that the location increases monotonically.\\nThe main difference from our approach is that, in (Graves, 2013), the modes of the weights of the\\nannotations only move in one direction. In the context of machine translation, this is a severe limi-\\ntation, as (long-distance) reordering is often needed to generate a grammatically correct translation\\n(for instance, English-to-German).\\nOur approach, on the other hand, requires computing the annotation weight of every word in the\\nsource sentence for each word in the translation. This drawback is not severe with the task of\\ntranslation in which most of input and output sentences are only 15–40 words. However, this may\\nlimit the applicability of the proposed scheme to other tasks.\\n8',\n",
       " 'Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2015\\n6.2 N EURAL NETWORKS FOR MACHINE TRANSLATION\\nSince Bengio et al. (2003) introduced a neural probabilistic language model which uses a neural net-\\nwork to model the conditional probability of a word given a ﬁxed number of the preceding words,\\nneural networks have widely been used in machine translation. However, the role of neural net-\\nworks has been largely limited to simply providing a single feature to an existing statistical machine\\ntranslation system or to re-rank a list of candidate translations provided by an existing system.\\nFor instance, Schwenk (2012) proposed using a feedforward neural network to compute the score of\\na pair of source and target phrases and to use the score as an additional feature in the phrase-based\\nstatistical machine translation system. More recently, Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013) and Devlin\\net al. (2014) reported the successful use of the neural networks as a sub-component of the existing\\ntranslation system. Traditionally, a neural network trained as a target-side language model has been\\nused to rescore or rerank a list of candidate translations (see, e.g., Schwenk et al. , 2006).\\nAlthough the above approaches were shown to improve the translation performance over the state-\\nof-the-art machine translation systems, we are more interested in a more ambitious objective of\\ndesigning a completely new translation system based on neural networks. The neural machine trans-\\nlation approach we consider in this paper is therefore a radical departure from these earlier works.\\nRather than using a neural network as a part of the existing system, our model works on its own and\\ngenerates a translation from a source sentence directly.\\n7 C ONCLUSION\\nThe conventional approach to neural machine translation, called an encoder–decoder approach, en-\\ncodes a whole input sentence into a ﬁxed-length vector from which a translation will be decoded.\\nWe conjectured that the use of a ﬁxed-length context vector is problematic for translating long sen-\\ntences, based on a recent empirical study reported by Cho et al. (2014b) and Pouget-Abadie et al.\\n(2014).\\nIn this paper, we proposed a novel architecture that addresses this issue. We extended the basic\\nencoder–decoder by letting a model (soft-)search for a set of input words, or their annotations com-\\nputed by an encoder, when generating each target word. This frees the model from having to encode\\na whole source sentence into a ﬁxed-length vector, and also lets the model focus only on information\\nrelevant to the generation of the next target word. This has a major positive impact on the ability\\nof the neural machine translation system to yield good results on longer sentences. Unlike with\\nthe traditional machine translation systems, all of the pieces of the translation system, including\\nthe alignment mechanism, are jointly trained towards a better log-probability of producing correct\\ntranslations.\\nWe tested the proposed model, called RNNsearch, on the task of English-to-French translation. The\\nexperiment revealed that the proposed RNNsearch outperforms the conventional encoder–decoder\\nmodel (RNNencdec) signiﬁcantly, regardless of the sentence length and that it is much more ro-\\nbust to the length of a source sentence. From the qualitative analysis where we investigated the\\n(soft-)alignment generated by the RNNsearch, we were able to conclude that the model can cor-\\nrectly align each target word with the relevant words, or their annotations, in the source sentence as\\nit generated a correct translation.\\nPerhaps more importantly, the proposed approach achieved a translation performance comparable to\\nthe existing phrase-based statistical machine translation.

Here, we\\ndescribe the choices we made for the experiments in this paper.\\nA.1.1 R ECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK\\nFor the activation function fof an RNN, we use the gated hidden unit recently proposed by Cho\\net al. (2014a). The gated hidden unit is an alternative to the conventional simple units such as an\\nelement-wise tanh . This gated unit is similar to a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit proposed\\nearlier by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997), sharing with it the ability to better model and learn\\nlong-term dependencies. This is made possible by having computation paths in the unfolded RNN\\nfor which the product of derivatives is close to 1. These paths allow gradients to ﬂow backward\\neasily without suffering too much from the vanishing effect (Hochreiter, 1991; Bengio et al. , 1994;\\nPascanu et al. , 2013a). It is therefore possible to use LSTM units instead of the gated hidden unit\\ndescribed here, as was done in a similar context by Sutskever et al. (2014).\\nThe new state siof the RNN employing ngated hidden units8is computed by\\nsi=f(si−1,yi−1,ci) = (1−zi)◦si−1+zi◦˜si,\\nwhere◦is an element-wise multiplication, and ziis the output of the update gates (see below). The\\nproposed updated state ˜siis computed by\\n˜si= tanh (We(yi−1) +U[ri◦si−1] +Cci),\\nwheree(yi−1)∈Rmis anm-dimensional embedding of a word yi−1, andriis the output of the\\nreset gates (see below). When yiis represented as a 1-of-Kvector,e(yi)is simply a column of an\\nembedding matrix E∈Rm×K. Whenever possible, we omit bias terms to make the equations less\\ncluttered.\\nThe update gates ziallow each hidden unit to maintain its previous activation, and the reset gates ri\\ncontrol how much and what information from the previous state should be reset. We compute them\\nby\\nzi=σ(Wze(yi−1) +Uzsi−1+Czci),\\nri=σ(Wre(yi−1) +Ursi−1+Crci),\\nwhereσ(·)is a logistic sigmoid function.\\nAt each step of the decoder, we compute the output probability (Eq. (4)) as a multi-layered func-\\ntion (Pascanu et al. , 2014). We use a single hidden layer of maxout units (Goodfellow et al. , 2013)\\nand normalize the output probabilities (one for each word) with a softmax function (see Eq. (6)).\\nA.1.2 A LIGNMENT MODEL\\nThe alignment model should be designed considering that the model needs to be evaluated Tx×Ty\\ntimes for each sentence pair of lengths TxandTy. In order to reduce computation, we use a single-\\nlayer multilayer perceptron such that\\na(si−1,hj) =v⊤\\natanh (Wasi−1+Uahj),\\nwhereWa∈Rn×n,Ua∈Rn×2nandva∈Rnare the weight matrices. Since Uahjdoes not\\ndepend oni, we can pre-compute it in advance to minimize the computational cost.\\n8Here, we show the formula of the decoder. The same formula can be used in the encoder by simply\\nignoring the context vector ciand the related terms.\\n12',\n",

From here on, we omit all bias terms in order to increase readability.\\nThe model takes a source sentence of 1-of-K coded word vectors as input\\nx= (x1,...,x Tx), xi∈RKx\\nand outputs a translated sentence of 1-of-K coded word vectors\\ny= (y1,...,y Ty), yi∈RKy,\\nwhereKxandKyare the vocabulary sizes of source and target languages, respectively.

We share the word embedding matrix\\nEbetween the forward and backward RNNs, unlike the weight matrices.\\nWe concatenate the forward and backward states to to obtain the annotations (h1,h2,···,hTx),\\nwhere\\nhi=[− →hi← −hi]\\n(7)\\nA.2.2 D ECODER\\nThe hidden state siof the decoder given the annotations from the encoder is computed by\\nsi=(1−zi)◦si−1+zi◦˜si,\\nwhere\\n˜si= tanh (WEy i−1+U[ri◦si−1] +Cci)\\nzi=σ(WzEyi−1+Uzsi−1+Czci)\\nri=σ(WrEyi−1+Ursi−1+Crci)\\nEis the word embedding matrix for the target language.

Any other weight matrix was initialized by sampling from the Gaussian distribution\\nof mean 0and variance 0.012.\\nB.2 T RAINING\\nWe used the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm.

Each SGD\\nupdate direction was computed with a minibatch of 80 sentences.\\nAt each update our implementation requires time proportional to the length of the longest sentence in\\na minibatch. Hence, to minimize the waste of computation, before every 20-th update, we retrieved\\n1600 sentence pairs, sorted them according to the lengths and split them into 20 minibatches. The\\ntraining data was shufﬂed once before training and was traversed sequentially in this manner.\\nIn Tables 2 we present the statistics related to training all the models used in the experiments.\\nC T RANSLATIONS OF LONG SENTENCES\\nSource An admitting privilege is the right of a doctor to admit a patient to a hospital or a medical centre\\nto carry out a diagnosis or a procedure, based on his status as a health care worker at a hospital.\\nReference Le privil `ege d’admission est le droit d’un m ´edecin, en vertu de son statut de membre soignant\\nd’un h ˆopital, d’admettre un patient dans un h ˆopital ou un centre m ´edical aﬁn d’y d ´elivrer un\\ndiagnostic ou un traitement.\\nRNNenc-50 Un privil `ege d’admission est le droit d’un m ´edecin de reconna ˆıtre un patient `a l’h ˆopital ou un\\ncentre m ´edical d’un diagnostic ou de prendre un diagnostic en fonction de son ´etat de sant ´e.\\nRNNsearch-50 Un privil `ege d’admission est le droit d’un m ´edecin d’admettre un patient `a un h ˆopital ou un\\ncentre m ´edical pour effectuer un diagnostic ou une proc ´edure, selon son statut de travailleur des\\nsoins de sant ´e`a l’h ˆopital.\\nGoogle\\nTranslateUn privil `ege admettre est le droit d’un m ´edecin d’admettre un patient dans un h ˆopital ou un\\ncentre m ´edical pour effectuer un diagnostic ou une proc ´edure, fond ´ee sur sa situation en tant\\nque travailleur de soins de sant ´e dans un h ˆopital.\\nSource This kind of experience is part of Disney’s efforts to ”extend the lifetime of its series and build\\nnew relationships with audiences via digital platforms that are becoming ever more important,”\\nhe added.\\nReference Ce type d’exp ´erience entre dans le cadre des efforts de Disney pour ” ´etendre la dur ´ee de\\nvie de ses s ´eries et construire de nouvelles relations avec son public gr ˆace`a des plateformes\\nnum´eriques qui sont de plus en plus importantes”, a-t-il ajout ´e.\\nRNNenc-50 Ce type d’exp ´erience fait partie des initiatives du Disney pour ”prolonger la dur ´ee de vie de\\nses nouvelles et de d ´evelopper des liens avec les lecteurs num ´eriques qui deviennent plus com-\\nplexes.\\nRNNsearch-50 Ce genre d’exp ´erience fait partie des efforts de Disney pour ”prolonger la dur ´ee de vie de ses\\ns´eries et cr ´eer de nouvelles relations avec des publics via des plateformes num ´eriques de plus\\nen plus importantes”, a-t-il ajout ´e.\\nGoogle\\nTranslateCe genre d’exp ´erience fait partie des efforts de Disney `a “´etendre la dur ´ee de vie de sa s ´erie et\\nconstruire de nouvelles relations avec le public par le biais des plates-formes num ´eriques qui\\ndeviennent de plus en plus important”, at-il ajout ´e.\\nSource In a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that might\\nconstitute a ”reasonable motive” that could lead to criminal charges being brought against the\\nmayor.\\nReference En conf ´erence de presse, jeudi, M.
